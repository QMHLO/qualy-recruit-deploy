                <h4>Career</h4>
                <p>After graduating from university, I worked as “Pharmaceutical Sales Representative” in Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. Subsequently, I transitioned to Recruit Co., Ltd., Japan’s largest IT services company, where I engaged in advertising and IT services sales for “Real Estate” companies. Utilizing unique sales and analytical methods, I received six internal commendations. Following a total of 4.5 years in sales, I became the Sales Director at a 6-year-old IT venture company, contributing to its success and earning a promotion to COO within six months. After serving in that role for 2.5 years, I went on to found my own company “Qualy, inc.” and “Qualy Myanmar Co., Ltd.”.</p>
